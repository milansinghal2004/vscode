But he is busy moving pawns and upgrading them to queens, so he wants your help in counting how many queens are currently attacking vikas's king.On an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.Given an array of integer coordinates queens that represent the positions of the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates king that represent the position of the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens that can attack the King.",Simulation,2D Array,Directional search
Possible words,"Vikas saw saurav typing something on his phone and sending a message and deleting it, he wants to know what the message was. But he only remembers the numbers that saurav pressed while typing the keys and not the letters, vikas has a classical keypad phone as shown in an image below. He cannot find out what saurav typed and wants your help in determining all the possibilities of words that could've been typed using the keys on the keypad. Help him by implementing a code that can output all the possible words that could have been typed given the numbers that were pressed.Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in sorted order. A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.",Mapping,Array,Backtracking
Count the flips,"Saurav and Vikas are learning about the sorting algorithms, they are very intrigued by the classical sorting algorithms. Vikas wants to come up with his own sorting algorithm, so he has implemented the following concept and wants to know how many frlips will be needed to sort the given set of integers using this method. Help him find out the answer by writing a code that can give the minimum number of reversals that will be needed.Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of flips.In one flip we do the following steps:Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).",Flip sort,Array,Pancake sorting
Bolt and thunder game,"Bolt and Thunder take turns playing a game, with Bolt starting first.Initially, there are N stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.Given a positive integer N, return true if and only if Bolt wins the game otherwise return false, assuming both players play optimally.",Array,DP Array,Dynamic programming
One valid path in a grid,"You are given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a direction pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The direction in grid[i][j] can be: 1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1]). 2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1]). 3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j]). 4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j]). Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.",Minimum cost,2D Grid,"BFS, DFS"
Duplicate removal 2,"Pushpendra is an engineering student, who has been trying to solve a sequence and series problem. However he was sleeping when the online classes were taken and his younger sister was helping him take notes and has tried her best to take down everything. But due to the teacher repeating then numbers in the list repeatedly she has taken down some numbers multiple times. Now pushpendra wants to remove all the duplicates from his list in order to better understand the concept and not get confused any further.Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.",Traversal,Linked list,Two pointers
Nesting Depth parentheses,"You are given a string seq of length n consisting only of the characters '(' and ')'. The string is a valid parentheses string (VPS) if it meets the following conditions: It is empty, or It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS, or It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS. The nesting depth of a VPS is defined as follows: depth("""") = 0 depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)) depth(""("" + A + "")"") = 1 + depth(A) For example: """", ()(), and ()(()) are VPS with depths 0, 1, and 2, respectively. )( and (() are not VPS.Your task is to split the given VPS seq into two distinct subsequences A and B such that Both A and B are valid parentheses strings.The maximum nesting depth of A and B is minimized.You need to return an array answer of length seq.length, where answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of A, and answer[i] = 1 if seq[i] is part of B.",Balancing depth,Array,Greedy approach
Box ab pattern,"You are given a row of boxes. Each box can be either ""a"" or ""b"". To check if it's an 'ab' pattern, you need to make sure that all the ""a"" boxes, if they exist, come before any ""b"" boxes, if they exist. If this order is maintained, it's an ab pattern; otherwise, it's not. Display ""YES"" if it is maintained else ""NO"".",Pass check,Array,No specific algorithm

Equivalent array of boxes,"In this coding scenario, you have two arrays of boxes, word1 and word2. The task is to determine if these boxes, when stacked in the same order, create identical structures.In other words, you should check if the elements in the two arrays, when concatenated in their respective orders, form the same string. If they do, the function should return true, indicating that the structures match; otherwise, it returns false, signifying a difference between the arrays.",String concatenation,Array,No specific algorithm

Collecting the apples,"In a garden with numerous apple trees labeled from 0 to N - 1, arranged in a row from left to right, the garden owner needs to collect all the apples to sell in the market. He has a basket with a capacity 'C' to collect the apples. The process for collecting the apples is as follows: 1. Begin at the starting point, which is at x = -1. 2. Collect apples from each tree in sequential order, moving from left to right. 3. If the basket becomes full before reaching the next tree, return to the starting point (x = -1), deposit the apples collected so far, and then resume from this starting position to continue collecting apples.The task is to determine the number of steps the garden owner will take to collect the final apple.",Simulation,Array,Simulation
Complex number multiplication,"A complex number can be represented as a string on the form ""real+imaginaryi"" where: real is the real part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100]. imaginary is the imaginary part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100]. i2 == -1.
